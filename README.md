# ReinforcementLearningROS
The ubuntu version of ReinforcementLearning which includes both 2D and 3D simulation.

# installation
System version: ubuntu20.04 \
ROS version: noetic \
Gazebo version: 11.0 \
Python version: 3.8 (3.7 and 3.6 maybe fine, but I didn't test them.)

# ROS Packages
TIPS: If you are not familiar with ubuntu and ROS (just like me...), I recommend you to implement your simulation work on Windows or just use 'twoD' modules'.
Because it is easier, and you can focus more on RL algorithms rather than the ROS-Gazebo simulation platform (it makes me mad.). \
Currently, all the demos have two versions: twoD and threeD. There is no difference for 'algorithm-related' work. \
twoD simulation is almost the identical to another repository: [ReinforcementLearning](https://github.com/ReinforcementLearning-StudyNote/ReinforcementLearning) \
threeD simulation is implemented on ROS-Gazebo (not finished yet).
